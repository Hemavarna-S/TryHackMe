## Introduction to Defensive Security
### Blue Team 
* Defending the organization's digital assets by monitoring systems in real-time. 
* Responsding effectively when threats emerge.
  **Tasks**
  * Educates users to avoid phishing,social engineering.
  * Helps to mapping devices and systems
  * Closes the vulnerablities before the attackers exploit.
  * Block unauthorized access
  * Tracks suspicious activity
   ### What Comes Next in Defensive Security
  * SOC - Security Operations Center: Center hub to monitor and incident response
  * Threat Intelligence - Tracking attacker and defending
  * DFIR ( Digital Forensics & Incident Response ) for investigating breaches and recovering securely
  * Malware Analysis - understand malware code behaves and spreads

    ## Areas of Defensive Security
    ### SOC
    * Monitor systems for threats like vulnerablities, policy violations
    * Real - time detection
    ### Threat Intelligence
    * Studing the attacker motive, TTPs( Tactics , Techniques and Procedures)
    * Use data from network logs, forums and threat feeds
      ### Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
       #### Digital Forensics
      * Analyzes evidence post-incident: file systems, RAM, logs, and network traffic.
      * Reveals what happened, how, and often who did it, even if traces are removed.
       #### Incident Response
      * Preparation
      * Detection & Analysis
      * Containment, Eradication, Recovery
      * Post-Incident Review
