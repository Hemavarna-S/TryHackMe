## Introduction
_Security Information and Event management _
* A Tool which collects the data from various end points and network devices and store that collected log in a centralized place

** Sysmon** : Sysmon refers to System Monitor, which is a Windows system service and device driver developed by Microsoft that is designed to monitor and log various events happening within a Windows system.

**Host-Centric Log Sources** 
Host-centric logs are generated by individual systems or endpoints, like Windows or Linux machines. These logs detail activities happening directly on the machine itself, not through network traffic or remote connections.
ex: Windows Events Logs, Sysmon.

**Network-Centric Logs**
This type of logs are generated when the host communicate across the network
_ex: SSH,VPN,HTTP/HTTPS,FTP_

**Importance of SIEM**
* Modern networks generate hundreds of events per second across endpoints, servers, and infrastructure.
* Analyzing logs manually device by device is not only impractical but dangerously slow in a live incident.
*_ ex : SIEM tools like Splunk, Elastic SIEM._

## Log Sources and Log Ingestion

**Windows Machine**
_'Event viewer' _ is used to view different logs in windows machine.


**Linux Workstation**
Linux OS stores all the related logs, such as events, errors, warnings, etc. Which are then ingested into SIEM for continuous monitoring

* **/var/log/httpd** - HTTP request and response and error
* **/var/log/cron** - Events related to cron jobs
* **/var/log/auth.log and /var/log/secure** - Stores authentication related logs
*** /var/log/kern** - file stores kernel related events
  Corn Jobs : Scheuduled Tasks which aoutomatically execute commands or scripts at specific times.

 ** Web Server**
 request/response logs 
 _/var/log/apache or /var/log/httpd_ in Apache

 **Log investigation**
 Analysing the logs
 * Agent / Forwarder : A light weight tool like splunk forwarder installed to EP to collect logs
 * Syslog : Syslog is a widely used protocol to collect data from various systems like web servers, databases, etc., are sent real-time data to the centralized destination.
 * Manual Upload : Allow Offile log data (CSV,JSON etc..) to be uploaded for analysis.
 * Port Forwading : Configure SIEM to listen on specific ports for incoming logs for remote systems.
